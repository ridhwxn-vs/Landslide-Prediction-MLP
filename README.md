# Landslide Prediction Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based landslide prediction model developed as part of a research study. The model utilizes Sentinel-2 imagery and terrain attributes to generate susceptibility maps for landslides in Wayanad, Kerala.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Analysis:** Utilizes Multilayer Perceptron Model for analysis.
- **Geospatial Data Integration:** Incorporates Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, elevation, slope, and other terrain factors.
- **Landslide Susceptibility Mapping:** Generates maps highlighting high-risk areas.
- **Real-World Case Studies:** Evaluates the model using historical landslide data from Chooralmala and Aanappara regions.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- Sentinel-2 satellite images (clipped to Wayanad, Kerala)
- Elevation and slope data derived from DEM
- Landslide inventory data for training and validation
